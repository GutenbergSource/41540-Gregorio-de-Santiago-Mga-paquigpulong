<HTML><BODY>Translation of the title in English: <i>Discussions in English and Visayan</i>

<p>This 1905 book was primarily meant for use by Cebuano speakers to learn English 'by example.' Given its 'no grammar'
approach, it works equally well (or not) the other way round. The book starts with thematic lists of words, followed by
a number of translated sentences on various words, short sample letters, and concludes with a pronunciation guide (of English).

<p>For modern users, two caveats apply: First, the spelling used is the old Spanish-derived orthography. This
is fairly distinct from the modern orthography. The most conspicuous changes are: <i>c</i> is now written as either <i>k</i>
or <i>s</i>, depending on the context; <i>qui</i> becomes <i>ki</i>, and <i>gui</i> becomes <i>gi</i>. The semivowel <i>w</i> is
represented by <i>o</i> (For example, <i>adlao</i> for <i>adlaw</i> 'sun', or <i>oala</i> for <i>wala</i> 'not'), and the semivowel <i>y</i> is not always
written (for example, <i>sia</i> for <i>siya</i> 'he'). The <i>g</i> with a tilde (to be entered as [~g]) is no longer used: modern Cebuano simply uses
the <i>g</i> in that case: the preceding <i>n</i> is enough to indicate the correct pronunciation. Second, the Cebuano used is sometimes rather formal, and does not reflect
modern usage in many cases. Common contractions as used in speech have not been applied. Even a native Cebuano speaker
might have trouble understanding some of the sentences, and consider the language very 'deep'.

<p>The book follows a two column format, which is handled differently depending on the nature of the columns.

<p>If the left column contains exclusively one-line words, the list can be represented as a single page, with the English
appearing on the left, and the Cebuano on the right.

<p>If the left column contains multi-line paragraphs, the two columns have been OCR-ed as separate columns, and the English text
appears on top, and the Cebuano at the bottom.

<p>The idea is that in the first case, entries are kept on one line, and in the latter case, the text will be transformed to have the English word, phrase or paragraph precede
the Cebuano, each as if it is a separate paragraph, such that you will read alternating English and Cebuano. This means some rearranging
of the text in P1. When a column continues on a next page, this may result in two broken paragraphs, in which case the first (English) will require a short note [**cont] at the end, so the PP-er can reconstruct the complete paragraph.</BODY></HTML>
