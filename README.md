| Description | This 1905 book was primarily meant for use by Cebuano speakers to learn English ‘by example.’ Given its ‘no grammar’ approach, it works equally well (or not) the other way round. The book starts with thematic lists of words, followed by a number of translated sentences on various themes, short sample letters, and concludes with a pronunciation guide (of English). |
